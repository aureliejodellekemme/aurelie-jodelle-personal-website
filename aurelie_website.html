            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Aurelie Jodelle Kemme, a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics specializing in Data Science,Proteins are essential biomolecules that play a crucial role in living organisms. Initially, a protein is synthesized as a linear chain of amino acids (its primary structure), which is called the polypeptide backbone. However, this linear sequence must fold into a specific three-dimensional (3D) structure to become functional, as structure determines function in proteins.

During the folding process, some proteins may form knots, meaning part of their backbone becomes entangled in a way that remains stable. These protein knots can be classified based on knot depth: 
            Shallow knots: These occur when the knotted region is close to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the protein sequence.

Deep knots: These are more complex and occur when the knotted region is buried deeper within the protein core.
            What causes a protein to form a knot during folding?

Are there specific sequence patterns that determine whether a protein will form a knot?

How do knotted proteins compare to unknotted proteins in terms of evolution, stability, and function?

My research aims to analyze knotted and unknotted proteins using persistent homology, a topological approach that helps detect structural differences. The goal is to identify patterns that distinguish knotted proteins from their unknotted counterparts and understand how these patterns influence protein folding, evolutionary processes, and stability.</p>
